  <h4>ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF DOGS:</h4>
  <P>Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that about 60 million years ago a small mammal, rather like a weasel, lived in the environs of what are now parts of Asia. It is called Miacis, the genus that became the ancestor of the animals known today as canids: dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes. Miacis did not leave direct descendants, but doglike canids evolved from it. By about 30 to 40 million years ago Miacis had evolved into the first true dog—namely, Cynodictis. This was a medium-size animal, longer than it was tall, with a long tail and a fairly brushy coat. Over the millennia Cynodictis gave rise to two branches, one in Africa and the other in Eurasia. The Eurasian branch was called Tomarctus and is the progenitor of wolves, dogs, and foxes.

      <li>Dogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first domesticated animals</li>
      <li>When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs served as herders and guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle.</li>
      <li>Today dogs are employed as guides for the blind and disabled or for police work.</li>
      <li>Dogs are even used in therapy in nursing homes and hospitals to encourage patients toward recovery.</li>

   <h6></h6><b>DOGS AS PETS:</b>
   <p>The companionship between humans and dogs is not a new phenomenon. However, in modern society most dogs are owned as pets, not because of the work they were bred to do. Many breeds, such as the toy dogs, were developed precisely to be pets. All of the diverse breeds and mixed breeds have unique traits and appeal to different kinds of people.</p>
<p>Acquiring a dog is a major decision, because the dog becomes totally dependent on its owner for its care and welfare. This responsibility continues throughout the life of the dog. Thus, the initial decision should be based on a serious consideration of whether one’s lifestyle truly lends itself to owning a dog—that is, whether a dog would be an asset rather than a liability.</p>
